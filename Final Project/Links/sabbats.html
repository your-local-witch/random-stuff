    <h2>Imbolc - February 2</h2>
        <h3 style="text-indent: 40px">Meaning of the Sabbat</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 60px">Imbolc is one of the four main fire festivals, which commemorates the changing of the Goddess from Crone to Maiden and celebrates the first signs of spring. It is also to celebrate Brigid(pronounced BREED), the Celtic Goddess of poetry, healing, smithcraft, and midwifery(all handmade activities).</p>

        <h3 style="text-indent: 40px">Traditons</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 60px">It is traditional that upon Imbolc, at sunset or after your own ritual, light every lamp in the house-- even if it is but a few moments. You may also, if there is snow outside, walk in it for a moment. Remember the warmth of summber before using your dominant hand to draw a sun in the snow. You may also consume dishes prepared with, or including, dairy, spices, raisins, and other foods symbolic of the sun. <a href="http://www.thewhitegoddess.co.uk/the_wheel_of_the_year/imbolc.asp" target="_blank">Credit</a></p>

        <h2 style="text-indent: 40px">Meaning of the Sabbat</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 60px">Mabon represents when Persephone was abducted by Hades, which sent the world into darkness each winter. This sabbat welcomes the archetype of the Dark Mother, and celebrates the aspect of the Triple Goddess which we may not always find comforting or appealing, but we must be willing to acknowledge.</p>
    
        <h2 style="text-indent: 40px">The God of Light, Defeated by His Brother, The God of Darkness</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 60px">“Mythically, this is the day of the year when the god of light is defeated by his twin and alter-ego, the god of darkness. It is the time of the year when night conquers day. The Autumnal Equinox is the only day of the whole year when Llew (light) is vulnerable and it is possible to defeat him. Llew now stands on the balance (Libra/autumnal equinox), with one foot on the cauldron (Cancer/summer solstice) and his other foot on the goat (Capricorn/winter solstice). Thus he is betrayed by Blodeuwedd, the Virgin (Virgo) and transformed into an Eagle (Scorpio). Two things are now likely to occur mythically, in rapid succession. Having defeated Llew, Goronwy (darkness) now takes over Llew’s functions, both as lover to Blodeuwedd, the Goddess, and as King of our own world. Although Goronwy, the Horned King, now sits on Llew’s throne and begins his rule immediately, his formal coronation will not be for another six weeks, occurring at Samhain (Halloween) or the beginning of Winter, when he becomes the Winter Lord, the Dark King, Lord of Misrule. Goronwy’s other function has more immediate results, however. He mates with the virgin goddess, and Blodeuwedd conceives, and will give birth — nine months later (at the Summer Solstice) — to Goronwy’s son, who is really another incarnation of himself, the Dark Child. Llew’s sacrificial death at Harvest Home also identifies him with John Barleycorn, spirit of the fields. Thus, Llew represents not only the sun’s power, but also the sun’s life trapped and crystallized in the corn. Often this corn spirit was believed to reside most especially in the last sheaf or shock harvested, which was dressed in fine clothes, or woven into a wicker-like man-shaped form. This effigy was then cut and carried from the field, and usually burned, amidst much rejoicing. So one may see Blodeuwedd and Goronwy in a new guise, not as conspirators who murder their king, but as kindly farmers who harvest the crop which they had planted and so lovingly cared for. And yet, anyone who knows the old ballad of John Barleycorn knows that we have not heard the last of him.”

        <h2 style="text-indent: 40px">Persephone and Hades</h2>
            <h3>The Abduction From Hades</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 60px">According to Greek Mythology, Persephone, the queen of the underworld, was the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of harvest and fertility. She was also called Kore, which means "maiden" and grew up to be a lovely girl attracting the attention of many gods. However, Demeter had an obsessed love for her only daughter and kept all men away from her. The most persisting suitor of Persephone was Hades, the god of the Underworld. He was a hard, middle-aged man, living in the dark, among the shadows of the Dead. But his heart softened when he saw Persephone and was amazed by his youth, beauty and freshness. When he asked Demeter to marry her daughter, Demeter got furious and said there wasn't the slightest chance for that to happen. Hades was heart-broken and decided to get Persephone no matter what. One day, while the young girl was playing and picking flowers along with her friends in a valley, she beheld the most enchanting narcissus she had ever seen. As she stooped down to pick the flower, the earth beneath her feet suddenly cleaved open and through the gap Hades himself came out on his chariot with black horses. Hades grabbed the lovely maiden before she could scream for help and descended into his underworld kingdom while the gap in the earth closed after them.</p>
            <h3>Desperately Looking For Persephone</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 60px">The other girls had not seen anything because everything happened very quickly. They didn't have a clue for the sudden disappearance of Persephone. The whole incident, however, had been witnessed by Zeus, father of the maiden and brother of the abductor, as well as by Helios, god of the Sun. Zeus decided to keep silent about the whole thing to prevent a fight with his brother while Helios wisely thought it better not to get involved in anything that didn't concern him. A distraught and heartbroken Demeter wandered the earth looking for her daughter until her good friend Hecate, goddess of wilderness and childbirth, advised her to seek for the help of Helios, the all-seeing Sun god, in order to find her daughter. Helios felt sorry for Demeter, who was crying and pleading him to help her. Thus she revealed her that Persephone had been kidnapped by Hades. When she heard that, Demeter got angry and wanted to take revenge but Helios suggested that it was not such a bad thing for Persephone to be the wife of Hades and queen of the dead.</p>
            <h3>Trying to Find a Solution</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 60px">Demeter, however, could not let it gone. She was furious at this insult and deeply believed that Hades, who after all had only dead people for company, was not the right husband for her sweet daughter. She also got angry at Zeus for not having revealed this to her. To punish gods and to grief, Demeter decided to take a long and indefinite leave from her duties as the goddess of harvest and fertility, with devastating consequences. The earth began to dry up,harvests failed, plants lost their fruitfulness, animals were dying for lack of food and famine spread to the whole earth, resulting in untold misery. The cries of the people who were suffering reached Olympus and the divine ears of Zeus. The mighty god finally realized that if he wouldn't do something about his wife's wrath, all humanity would disappear. Thus he tried to find another solution to both calm Demeter and please Hades. He promised Demeter to restore Persephone to her if it can be proved that the maiden stays with Hades against her will. Otherwise, Persephone belongs to her husband.</p> 
            <h3>The Final Solution</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 60px">The crafty Hades learned this agreement and tricked his reluctant bride, who was crying all day and night from despair, to eat a few seeds of the pomegranate fruit. This was the food of the Underworld and every time someone ate even a few seeds of this, then, after a while, he would miss life in the Underworld. When the gathering in front of Zeus took place and Persephone was asked where she would like to live, she answered she wanted to live with her husband. When Demeter heard that, she got infuriated and accused Hades that somehow he had tricked her daughter. A great fight followed and Demeter threatened that she would never again make the earth fertile and everyone on Earth would die. To put an ed on this quarrel, Zeus decided that Persephone would spend half months with her husband in Hades and half months with her mother on Olympus. This alternative pleased none of the two opponents, nevertheless that had no other option but accept it.</p>
            <h3>The Explanation of the Myth</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 60px">Thus the lovely maiden Persephone became the rightful wife of Hades and Queen of the Underworld. During the six months that Persephone spent in the Underworld, her mother was sad and not in the mood to deal with harvest. Thus she would leave the Earth to decline. According to the ancient Greeks, these were the months of Autumn and Winter, when the land is not fertile and does not give crops. Whenever Persephone went to Olympus to live with her mother, Demeter would shine from happiness and the land would become fertile again and fruitful. These were the months of Spring and Summer. Therefore, this myth was created to explain the change of the seasons, the eternal cycle of the Nature's death and rebirth.</p>

    <h1>Samhain - October 31/November 1</h1><br>
        <h2 style="text-indent: 40px">Meaning of the Sabbat</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 60px">Samhain is known as a time to honour the Dark Mother and Father, and to commune with or honour ancestors or other spirits. It's also a great time to do a general ritual for those who passed the previous year, since Samhain is also the Witch's New Year.</p>
    <br>
    
    
        <h2 style="text-indent: 40px">Traditions</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 60px">Originally known as the "Feast of the Dead", this sabbat was celebrated in Celtic countries by leaving food offerings on altars and doorsteps for the "wandering dead." Others nowadays, light a single candle in their window to help guide the spirits of ancestors and loved ones home. Extra chairs were set at the table and around the hearth for unseen guests, apples were buried along roadsides and paths for spirits who had no descendants to provide for them, turnips were hollowed out and carved to look like protective spirits, for this was a night of magick and chaos.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 60px">This was also the time that the cattle and other livestock were slaughtered for eating in the ensuing winter months. Any crops still in the field on Samhain were considered taboo, and left as offerings to the Nature spirits. Bonfires were built, (originally called bone-fires, for after feasting, the bones were thrown in the fire as offerings for healthy and plentiful livestock in the New Year) and stones were marked with peoples names. Then they were thrown into the fire, to be retrieved in the morning. The condition of the retrieved stone foretold of that person's fortune in the coming year. Hearth fires were also lit from the village bonfire to ensure unity, and the ashes were spread over the harvested fields to protect and bless the land.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 60px">Many used the sabbat to hone their psychic and divinitory skills, especially with regard to love and marriage.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 60px">The Wee Folke became very active, pulling pranks on unsuspecting humans. Traveling after dark was was not advised. People dressed in white (like ghosts), wore disguises made of straw, or dressed as the opposite gender in order to fool the Nature spirits.</p>
